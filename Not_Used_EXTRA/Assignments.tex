Week 4.1
_____________

Set up groups of 2 to 3 to work on the group assignment

Familiarize with the code of the FlexTOPO model and associated datasets for the sub-basin in the data folder above

Setup a group working document with an outline for the assignment report. Add a brief background review on food-environment tradeoffs (nexus) in the Cauvery river basin. 

Week 4.2 
_______________

Question 1: Obtain the coupled difference equation of coupled environmental quality and economic growth model.

Question 2. Using the code, how taxation affects the dynamics (co-evolution) of quality and growth? Let E0 = 0.2, k0 = 0.01(low initial environment quality and a poor society). All other parameters (Slide 44) remain the same except tax rate , i.e. the society is environmentally conscious and forms habit for good environment quality over time. Consider tax rates tau = 0, 0.05, 0.10. What do you think is the optimal tax policy for the society so parameterized? Discuss your results.

Question 3: Discuss functional form of a utility function that you will use to assess Cauvery in your project assignemnt. Which two variables would it be function of? How should consumption and environment quality be estimated from the FlexTOPO model of the basin?
