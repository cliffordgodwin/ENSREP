\section{Will not in the final report: Only for our reference}

\textbf{Objective:} Understanding the implications of hydrological alterations in Cauvery on community welfare and sustainable development

\textbf{Key research questions: }
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How agricultural intensification in the basin degrades water quality and in turn degrades  the provision of ecosystem services?
    \item What does the above mean in terms of trade off between agricultural production and delivery of ecosystem services (i.e. production possibility frontier )?
    \item How to conceptualize how basin stakeholders prefer agriculture  production over ecosystem services (welfare or utility function of the basin)?
    \item What does the current situation of the basin mean in terms of how basin stakeholders prefer agricultural production versus  delivery of ecosystem services?
    
\end{enumerate}
